All files in the "project_2" folder should compile and run. 
Run MainMenu to open a GUI menu to play any of the games (which runs the PlayX.java file for game X). 

Images should work if they're in the folder above the compiled files. If this doesn't work, the relative path could be changed from "./Project_2/Elephant.png" to "Elephant.png" and the file be in the same folder as the compiled files.
